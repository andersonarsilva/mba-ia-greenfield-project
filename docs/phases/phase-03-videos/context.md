## Decisions Detail

### phase-03-videos/TD-01

**Recommendation:** the phase needs exactly one queue with robust failure semantics (ack/nack, retry, DLQ), and RabbitMQ provides them in the broker itself, keeping the worker a genuinely independent container as drawn in the C4 diagram; it avoids adding Redis as a second stateful dependency whose only role would be carrying jobs. BullMQ is a close second and equally defensible if a Redis cache is already foreseen for later phases.
**Libraries:** amqplib

### phase-03-videos/TD-02

**Recommendation:** it is the native S3/MinIO mechanism that satisfies the 10GB requirement with zero API involvement in the byte path, per-part parallelism/retry, and no new infrastructure; the draft pre-registration slots naturally into the "initiate" step.
**Libraries:** @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner

### phase-03-videos/TD-03

**Recommendation:** same codebase, separate container, direct `child_process` invocation of `ffprobe` (metadata/duration, `-print_format json`) and `ffmpeg` (single-frame thumbnail extraction); it reuses everything phases 01–02 built while honoring the architecture's separate-worker container, and avoids depending on the archived `fluent-ffmpeg`.
**Libraries:** —
**Revisions:**
- 2026-08-04 — Persisted metadata contract fixed: typed columns (`duration_seconds`, `width`, `height`, `codec`, `container`, `size_bytes`) plus a `jsonb` column holding the raw ffprobe output. Rationale: parameter clarified for the Data Model — typed columns keep listing/ordering queries indexable while the raw JSON avoids a migration each time a new field is needed.

### phase-03-videos/TD-04

**Recommendation:** matches the platform reference model (YouTube-like short IDs), stays stable from draft creation onward regardless of later title edits, and the unique index + retry makes conflicts a non-issue; UUID stays as internal PK, consistent with previous phases.
**Libraries:** nanoid

### phase-03-videos/TD-05

**Recommendation:** it matches the architecture diagram literally (frontend streams from Object Storage), reuses MinIO's native, battle-tested Range implementation instead of hand-rolling one, and keeps the API on the control plane only, for both streaming and download.
**Libraries:** —
**Revisions:**
- 2026-08-04 — Phase 03 access rule fixed: stream and download are owner-only (authenticated channel owner). Rationale: parameter tightened by phase boundary — visibility/publication lands in Phase 04 and anonymous viewing in Phase 05, so every video in this phase is an unpublished draft.

### phase-03-videos/TD-06

**Recommendation:** the `uploaded` intermediate state distinguishes "waiting for worker" from "worker running" (useful for UX and stuck-job detection), and bounded retry + DLQ is the standard failure contract for queue consumers; fail-fast on a 10GB re-upload is an unacceptable user cost for the few lines of retry topology it saves.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-07

**Recommendation:** per-video prefixes make asset co-location and future deletion trivial, a single bucket minimizes config surface for a phase where both asset types are delivered via presigned URLs anyway, and the init container keeps provisioning declarative and idempotent in Compose (matching how the rest of the local infra is provisioned).
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-08

**Recommendation:** native lifecycle handles the expensive half (10GB of parts) with zero code and total reliability, the cron sweep is trivial and keeps the DB honest, and the explicit abort endpoint covers the cooperative path; configure the lifecycle via `mc ilm` in the TD-07 init container to avoid the known client-persistence pitfalls.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/schedule

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.
**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.
**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.
**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.
**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Architectural fit.** The strict-BFF model in `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` already nominates the Route Handler as the only NestJS caller; cookie-based sessions are the natural match, and Auth.js's framework adds layers between the BFF and the cookie that buy nothing because the backend is the auth authority. (2) **Smaller blast radius.** A ~50-LOC session helper is grep-friendly, debuggable, and test-friendly via the existing MSW+BFF integration test pattern. (3) **Compatibility with Next.js 16 / React 19.** Built-in `next/headers` `cookies()` is the canonical primitive both runtimes already use. Option C is rejected as unsafe (`localStorage` for refresh tokens) and architecturally regressive (loses RSC personalization).
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Defense in depth on the cookie content** — `httpOnly` blocks JS, encryption blocks accidental log/proxy inspection; the marginal cost is one ~3KB dep. (2) **Single cookie to manage** simplifies logout and avoids the orphan-cookie failure mode. (3) **Room to carry minimal user metadata** (`userId`, `email`, `channelSlug`) lets `app/layout.tsx` RSC render the authenticated chrome without a per-render `/auth/me` round-trip.
**Libraries:** iron-session

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The single-flight detail is non-trivial and goes in the helper from day one — tested by MSW with a "two concurrent intercepted upstream calls; one refresh expected" assertion. Option B's client-driven pattern is rejected because it doesn't replace Option A (RSC still needs server-side refresh). Option C's pre-emptive timer is rejected because the failure modes (multiple tabs, sleep/wake) outweigh the latency saving.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Decoupled from TD-05** — works with Route Handlers OR Server Actions. (2) **Aligned with shadcn's canonical form primitive** — react-hook-form is the supported primitive. (3) **Zod-first developer ergonomics match the rest of the FE foundation.**
**Libraries:** react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Strict-BFF alignment.** Route Handlers as the BFF surface keeps every mutation visible under `app/api/**`. (2) **Test scaffold already exists** for Route-Handlers-as-functions. (3) **Single mutation surface** — Phase 02 sets the precedent for Phases 03–07; uniformity beats per-mutation idiom-picking.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Two reinforcing reasons. (1) **No first-render flicker, no round-trip** — the session is delivered in the same response as the page HTML. (2) **No new BFF endpoint** — the cookie is the source of truth, RSC reads it, the Provider broadcasts it. The `router.refresh()` requirement after mid-session mutations is a small price.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **First-paint-correct** — the user sees the right outcome on the first paint. (2) **Single integration pattern across both flows** — both share the "RSC owns the token, Client Component owns the input" split. (3) **Email-prefetch behavior** is solved at the backend's idempotent-confirmation level.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-01

**Recommendation:** é a única opção que preserva as decisões anteriores (`class-validator` em TD-06 de phase-02-auth) sem re-platform; o CLI plugin com `classValidatorShim: true` aproveita os decoradores `class-validator` existentes para inferir schemas, mantendo o boilerplate baixo. Nestia tem mérito técnico real mas o custo de migração do stack de validação inviabiliza-a sem uma decisão upstream de supersede de TD-06. Manual authoring é descartado.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/swagger

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-02

**Recommendation:** o custo marginal sobre Option A é apenas um npm script (~15 linhas) e o benefício é uma fundação correta para futura integração FE (codegen offline) sem perder a UI interativa que dev/QA usam. Option B sozinho pune a experiência de desenvolvimento em dev/local; Option A sozinho compromete o pipeline de codegen futuro. Combinar é dominante.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-03

**Recommendation:** alinha com a postura defensiva já estabelecida em phase 02 e não compromete consumidores legítimos (o `openapi.json` commitado em TD-02 cumpre o papel de "spec consultável fora da UI"). Re-abrir como Option A ou C é trivial no futuro se um caso de uso de API pública aparecer.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** `lib/env.ts` exports a typed `env` object with no `as` casts, satisfying the project's "Type Safety" working principle. (2) **Ecosystem gravity in Next.js / React 19** — Zod is the de-facto schema language for App Router (Server Actions inputs, form resolvers, future contract validation), so introducing it once at the env layer compounds value for forms in Phase 02+. (3) **Direct enablement of TD-02 Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`)** — t3-env's first-citizen validator. Backend parity with Joi is not load-bearing: env schemas are not shared FE↔BE (different runtimes, different key sets); two validators across two subprojects is a bounded cost.
**Libraries:** zod

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** well-spent for the strongest boundary among the three.
**Libraries:** @t3-oss/env-nextjs

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** single server-only `API_URL`)**. Aligned with the BFF testing strategy and architectural commitment already documented in `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` (Route Handlers as the only NestJS caller; BFF tests stub `fetch` via MSW). Eliminates CORS, eliminates public exposure of the backend URL, and produces the smallest correct foundation. Option B's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is a future-proofing concession with no current consumer — and adding a public key later is a non-breaking change, while removing one is breaking. Option C ties a foundational decision to infra work explicitly deferred elsewhere. The Docker networking gap (how server-in-container resolves the backend) is a separate orthogonal decision, surfaced below.

> **Out-of-scope ancillary note (NOT a TD here):** Once Option A is chosen, the concrete _value_ of `API_URL` in dev (`http://host.docker.internal:3000` vs joining the two Compose stacks into a shared network with `http://nestjs-api:3000`) is a Docker-Compose-topology decision that this research does not resolve. It belongs in either Phase 02's pre-work or a dedicated infra ad-hoc TD. The env-key contract (this TD) is intentionally independent of how the value is resolved at runtime.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-01

**Recommendation:** the project should not invent its own scheme when the official one is documented and matches the codebase's domain orientation. (2) **Domain ownership tracks the codebase**, not the project plan — `components/`, `app/api/`, and any future feature folders will be organized by domain (auth, videos, channels), so handler files mirror that vocabulary and remain stable as phases come and go. (3) **Append-only growth with minimal merge conflicts** — each phase touches a new file plus one line in the barrel, which is the smallest practical concurrent-PR footprint. Option A is acceptable through Phase 02 alone (~5–7 endpoints) but accumulates costs that B avoids from day one; bootstrapping directly into B costs one extra file and one barrel and pays off by Phase 03. Option C's phase coupling is rejected outright — domain-by-phase is a category error.

> **File naming inside each domain module.** Inside `handlers/<domain>.ts`, group handlers by **HTTP method + path** rather than by test scenario — a single handler is the happy-path default; per-test error/edge scenarios are added via `server.use(...)` in the test file, never as additional handlers in the domain file. This keeps the domain file small and stable (one handler per `paths` entry, not one handler per assertion case).
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-02

**Recommendation:** the trigger for re-opening this TD with a Supersede toward Option B-style wiring:

- A dedicated capability appears in `docs/project-plan.md` or a phase plan that requires FE-offline dev (e.g., Storybook with mocked API responses; design-system playground that renders real-data states; FE-team-only sprints with the BE stack down).
- The number of BFF Route Handlers grows past the point where running the full stack just to dev a single FE page is the dominant pain.

Under Option A, when that day comes, the path to Option B is additive: `npx msw init public/` to generate the SW file, create `mocks/browser.ts`, create `mocks/handlers/bff/` mirroring the upstream tree, register the worker behind a `NEXT_PUBLIC_MSW` flag. The existing `handlers/<domain>.ts` files (upstream-targeted) keep working unchanged.

> **Directory naming under Option A.** Do not preemptively name handler files `upstream/auth.ts` to "leave room for Option B later" — that's premature complexity. Use the flat `handlers/auth.ts` per TD-01 today; if Option B is ever taken, the migration is "move `handlers/*.ts` into `handlers/upstream/` and add a sibling `handlers/bff/`" — a one-commit refactor with no test changes (the barrel keeps the same import surface to `mocks/server.ts`).
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-03

**Recommendation:** every fixture in Phase 02 (5–7 endpoints, single-record-mostly) is naturally hand-written, and the diff-revealing override pattern is the highest-value benefit. (2) **Bulk-collection cases will arrive (Phase 07 home page grid, Phase 06 comment threads) and inline hand-written lists of 20+ items are genuinely tedious** — keeping faker available as a scoped tool is pragmatic. (3) **Per-fixture local seeding eliminates the global-cursor pitfall** that makes Option C structurally fragile — using `faker.seed(N)` immediately before a collection-builder run scopes the determinism to that fixture and isolates it from upstream changes to other factories.

Concrete pattern for D:

```ts
// mocks/factories/videos.ts  (Option B style — default case)
const baseVideo: Video = { id: "video-1", title: "First video", durationSec: 120, /* ... */ };
export const buildVideo = (overrides: Partial<Video> = {}): Video => ({ ...baseVideo, ...overrides });

// Opt-in faker for a bulk-list scenario only:
import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";
export const buildVideoList = (n: number, seed = 42): Video[] => {
  faker.seed(seed); // local — does not affect any other factory
  return Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) =>
    buildVideo({ id: `video-${i + 1}`, title: faker.lorem.sentence(4), durationSec: faker.number.int({ min: 60, max: 3600 }) }));
};
```

If the project never reaches a real bulk-collection use case, faker is simply never installed — Option D collapses into Option B in practice, with zero retroactive cost. Add `@faker-js/faker` to `devDependencies` only when the first `buildXList` is authored.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-04

**Recommendation:** they `import { POST } from "@/app/api/auth/signup/route"`, build a `Request`, await the handler, and assert. Per-test deviations call `server.use(...)` inline.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-01

**Recommendation:** one `.d.ts` file imported wherever the contract is touched. (3) **MSW typing is solved by the same `paths` symbol.** Hand-written handlers in `mocks/handlers.ts` type their resolver returns off `paths["/videos"]["get"]["responses"][200]`, giving the contract guarantee without orval/kubb's verbose generated handlers (which would be overridden per-test anyway). The marginal cost of adding `openapi-fetch` (~6KB, server-side only) is small enough that we recommend the **types + thin-client** pair, not types alone — `openapi-fetch` removes the `fetch(API_URL + path, { method, headers, body })` boilerplate in each Route Handler while staying within the BFF model. Options B/C/D may be revisited if (a) client-side data-fetching enters the stack with TanStack Query and per-endpoint hooks are wanted, or (b) the API grows beyond ~20 operations and per-call boilerplate becomes painful.
**Libraries:** openapi-typescript, openapi-fetch

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-02

**Recommendation:** neither subproject's compose file references the other. (2) **Drift is eliminated structurally when paired with TD-03's CI freshness check** — the check runs the sync script and asserts no diff on either `openapi.json` or `types.gen.ts`, so a backend PR that forgets to re-sync fails CI with a clear message. (3) **The committed local file is a real artifact in PR review** — reviewers see the contract change in `next-frontend/openapi.json`'s diff at the same time as the backend change, doubling the visibility (an `openapi.json`-only diff in a feature PR is a red flag for accidental drift). Option A is acceptable as a pre-CI fallback; Option C is rejected because the cross-stack file dependency in `docker-compose.yaml` introduces coupling that the current architecture explicitly avoids, and the "no drift" gain over B is small once TD-03 lands.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-03

**Recommendation:** **Option C (committed + CI freshness check)**. It is the only option that makes contract drift _both_ visible (in PR diffs) _and_ impossible to merge accidentally (CI fail). The complexity premium over Option A is one CI step. Option B's "no committed artifacts" purity is poorly paid for in a monorepo where the cross-subproject build coupling becomes a real ergonomic cost, and it wastes the PR visibility that TD-02 Option B's committed `openapi.json` is specifically designed to deliver. Option A is acceptable as a temporary state until the CI pipeline lands; downgrading from C to A is reversible (just remove the CI step) but upgrading to C later requires explaining `types.gen.ts` history in a separate commit. Start at C. Apply the same script-and-check pattern to any future generated artifact (e.g., if `openapi-fetch` is wrapped, the wrapper file is hand-written; the only generated artifact remains `types.gen.ts`).

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-04

**Recommendation:** for the scope of StreamTube, the BFF will likely have <30 contract aliases at peak; sectioning by feature header comments is sufficient. Make `lib/api/contracts.ts` the only file that imports `paths` from `types.gen.ts` (lintable later); every other consumer imports from `contracts.ts`.

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-05

**Recommendation:** BFF integration tests assert on specific values; randomized fixtures are anti-helpful. (2) **Coherence with TD-01 recommendation** — `openapi-typescript`'s `paths` type is the single contract anchor; reusing it in MSW handlers means "spec ↔ handler ↔ assertion" is one type chain. (3) **Scale fit** — Phase 02 introduces few endpoints; the manual cost is negligible at this stage. If the API grows to dozens of endpoints and authoring overhead becomes real, this TD can be superseded with a Kubb-or-hey-api MSW plugin without touching TD-01's `paths` import sites (the generator just produces additional handler files; the existing manual handlers stay valid). Option B locks the project into a heavier TD-01 choice for marginal mock-authoring savings; Option C is Option A with an unnecessary detour.

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and the CLI data source. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. Documented as a known gap. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | a tela de confirmação da conta não será implementada nesta fase corrente, será adiada — the umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per Non-UI rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |

## Testing Requirements

### nestjs-project

| Artifact type | Required layers |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Entity (`*.entity.ts`) | Integration: constraints, defaults, `select: false` |
| Service with branching + DB | Unit: branch logic (mock repo) + Integration: DB contract |
| Service with DB only (no branching) | Integration: DB contract |
| Service with configured lib (JWT, cache) | Unit: real lib with test config |
| Service with side-effect dep (email, storage, queue) | Integration: real capture service (Mailpit/MinIO/RabbitMQ via Compose) or local adapter |
| Module with configured imports | Unit: compilation test |
| Controller | E2E only — do NOT write unit tests |
| DTO | E2E: one validation wiring test per endpoint |
| Guard (delegates to service for business logic) | E2E + Unit if complex internal logic |
| Guard (simple, delegates to framework) | E2E only |
| Pipe (custom transformation/validation) | Unit |
| Interceptor (response transform, logging) | Unit and/or E2E |
| Exception Filter | Unit + E2E |
| Middleware | E2E |

### next-frontend

_Deferred subproject — video UI is out of scope this phase; testing requirements will apply when the UI phase consumes the Cross-layer contracts (TD-02, TD-05)._
